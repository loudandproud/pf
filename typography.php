                <p class="description-p">East Asian Serif is an original typeface created in Typography class. I noticed that most of all the typeface having Asian taste are script fonts.
                I decided to try to make a typeface having both serif and asian taste by giving them East Asian caligraphy feature.

                <p class="eas-cp">As you may know, creating font usually takes a couple of years. It was really too defficult to make a decent serif font in two months,
                so I used two existing fonts, Optima and Kozuka Mincho to make the process faster. I started from copy optima as basic shape for my font,
                and cut some parts of Kozuka Mincho character and mix and tweak them to look nice by using Adobe Illustrator.</p>
