                <p class="description-p">East Asian Serif is an original typeface created in Typography class. I noticed that most of all the typeface having Asian style were script fonts.
                I decided to try to make a typeface having both serif and Asian style by giving them East Asian calligraphy features.

                <p class="eas-cp-dcp">As you may know, creating font usually takes a couple of years. It was really too difficult to make a decent serif font in two months,
                so I used two existing fonts, Optima and Kozuka Mincho to make the process faster. I started by copying Optima as the basic shape for my font,
                and cut some parts of Kozuka Mincho characters and mixed and tweaked them to look nice by using Adobe Illustrator.</p>
