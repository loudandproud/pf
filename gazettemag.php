            <p class="description-p">Gazette Magazine is a local art, culture, and news magazine. 
            The magazine started in Gastown two years ago online. It featured local events, underground arts, music, fashion, and people living in Gastown. 
            The first hard-copy edition was successfully published last January, and the second issue will come out soon.

                    <h2 class="page-h2 gzt-h2">It started from concept making</h2>
                    <p class="gzt-cardstop-p">When I got down to working on Gazette's website, the first thing that I realized was that it was lacking any sort of concept. I believe giving people inspiration is essential for a media company, 
                    and concept is a core factor which affects all the branding and content strategy.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    An enthusiastic email explaining the importance of having a concept was sent to all the core members. 
                    The talents gathered, and a brainstorming meeting took place. After two intensive meetings, we streamlined our thoughts into one core idea;
                    <br> <i>"Evolve together."</i>

                    <p class="gzt-ftimgs-p">The beautiful images were used in the entire website. Some editorials talk about heart-felt stories of local people, artists, and community.</p>
                    <p>The concept "Evolove together." inspired me to dramatically layout images so that they would resonate with the stories and the readers.</p>

                <p class="gzt-ad-p">
                Banners are not merely ads, it also gives the layout rhythm. Banner areas are carefully decided to match the layout. 
                It also rotates other banners on each ad-area every ten seconds. The ad revenue is a key engine of a media business. 
                The new layout doubled the number of banner-clicks, and increased advertising revenues which was huge for a media company.

                    Related posts are placed under each post and on the sidebar of the desktop. That enhances the userâ€²s circulation.

                    <p>You might also notice that the brand slogan; "Evolve together." is placed under the content area of each post with their logo.
                    That helps to link the user's feelings with the content, and ties various stories into one concept.</p>
